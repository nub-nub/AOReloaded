# AOReloaded

DLL injection mod framework for the Anarchy Online client. Masquerades as `version.dll` (DLL search order hijacking) to load into the game process.

## Build

```bash
cmake --preset debug    # or release, dev
cmake --build build/debug
```

Clang-cl + Ninja, targeting x86 (i686-pc-windows-msvc). Static CRT. Auto-deploys `version.dll` and PDB to `../client/` on build.

```

## How It Works

1. Windows loads our `version.dll` from client dir before System32's.
2. `DllMain` inits logging, spawns deferred init thread (can't resolve game APIs under loader lock).
3. Deferred thread polls for `Utils.dll`, resolves exported C++ methods by mangled name.
4. Registers custom DValues (e.g. `AOR_TestToggle`) via `AddVariable`.
5. Polls for `camera_mode` to detect game-world entry.
6. Game API functions called through resolved pointers.

## Key APIs (from Utils.dll)

All resolved by MSVC mangled name — stable as long as method signatures don't change.

| Function | Mangled Name | Calling Conv |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `SetDValue(static)` | `?SetDValue@DistributedValue_c@@SAXABVString@@ABVVariant@@@Z` | `__cdecl` |
| `GetDValue(static)` | `?GetDValue@DistributedValue_c@@SA?AVVariant@@ABVString@@_N@Z` | `__cdecl`, hidden ret ptr |
| `DoesVariableExist` | `?DoesVariableExist@DistributedValue_c@@SA_NABVString@@@Z` | `__cdecl` |
| `AddVariable` | `?AddVariable@DistributedValue_c@@SAXABVString@@ABVVariant@@_N2@Z` | `__cdecl` |

## DValue System

Game's CVar equivalent. Named string keys → Variant values in global thread-safe registry. Any game setting can be read/written by name.

**Full dump of all 268 registered DValues** was captured on 2026-04-14. Key categories:
- Cat 0: Runtime state (CharacterID, Username)
- Cat 1: Client-wide persistent (resolution, font, sound)
- Cat 2: Per-user prefs (mouse, zoom, volume, ESC toggles)
- Cat 3: Per-character UI state (window configs, visibility)
- Cat 4: Transient signals (camera_mode, module activators)

## Options Panel Integration

The game's options panel is pure data-driven XML at `client/cd_image/gui/Default/OptionPanel/Root.xml`. An **AOReloaded tab** has been added with test widgets bound to custom DValues. To add new options:

1. Register DValue in `dllmain.cpp` via `GameAPI::RegisterBool/Int/Float`
2. Add widget XML to the AOReloaded `<ScrollView>` in `Root.xml`
3. Widget types: `OptionCheckBox`, `OptionSlider`, `OptionRadioButtonGroup`
4. Bind via `opt_variable="YourDValueName"` and `opt_type="variant"`

## Confirmed Working (2026-04-14)

- SetDValue: changed ChatFontSize 140→300, visible in-game
- GetDValue: reads current values correctly
- DoesVariableExist: correctly reports presence/absence by game state
- AddVariable: registers custom DValues that game's option widgets bind to
- DValue dump: walked all 268 entries from global std::map tree
- Options panel: AOReloaded tab appears in F10 settings with working test widgets
- **Inline hook engine** (`src/hooks/hook_engine.cpp`): 5-byte `jmp rel32` over verified prologues. Supports the standard hot-patch prologue plus several MSVC frame-prologues (`55 8B EC 51 5x`, etc.). Trampoline preserves callee-cleanup conventions (e.g. `RET 4`).
- **CalcSteering hook** on `CameraVehicleFixedThird_t` (N3.dll RVA `0x1f752`): per-frame yaw-follow active, lerps the heading vector at `vehicle+0x1F8` toward "behind character" using angle-based interpolation. LMB-held detected via `GetAsyncKeyState(VK_LBUTTON)`. See `src/hooks/camera_hook.cpp`.
- **RMB-align** in the same hook: on `VK_RBUTTON` press edge (while `AOR_CamOn` is true), computes `delta = -π/2 - atan2(hz, hx)` from the local heading, snaps `+0x1F8`/`+0x200` to `(0, -lenXZ)`, then rotates the player dynel via `n3Dynel_t::SetRelRot(Quaternion const&)` (N3.dll RVA `0x409b`). **Order matters**: the heading reset MUST precede `SetRelRot` — `SetRelRot` triggers a synchronous cascade (locality notify → recompute camera target) that reads camera heading × char-yaw. If the heading were still at its pre-snap offset, the cascade would render one frame of the camera at a doubly-rotated (offset × rotation delta) position. One-shot per RMB press; no-op when camera is already aligned.
- **Options panel SSO limit**: DValue names bound to `OptionCheckBox`/`OptionSlider` MUST be ≤ 15 chars. `AOString::FromShort` silently returns an empty string for longer names, which corrupts the registry and hangs the slider widget. Sliders also expect Int (not Float) DValues — Float-bound sliders render with no knob and hang on click.

## Caveats / footguns

- DValue name length: see SSO limit above. If a slider hangs the game on click, suspect this first.
- Detour calling conventions: hooked `__thiscall` methods need a detour with `__fastcall` signature (`ECX`=this, `EDX`=junk). The trampoline must keep the original `__thiscall` typing or `RET N` cleanup will mis-balance the stack.
- `RecalcOptimalPos` rotates the heading at `vehicle+0x1F8` by the character-yaw quaternion at `vehicle+0x16c` before computing the optimal camera position. Writing to `+0x1F8` in **world space** produces wrong directions; instead, write the **local-space** target (e.g. local "behind" is the constant `(0, 0, -1)`) and let the rotation produce world-space output.

## Graphics Research

Deep-dive notes on the client's rendering/lighting/asset systems live in `docs/graphics/`:
- `shadows_lighting.md` — three-light-bank forward renderer, drop-shadow model, day/night (base-game), AOReloaded possibilities
- `textures.md` — `rdb.db` is SQLite3 with JPEG/PNG texture blobs in tables `rdb_1010004/08/09/16/17/23/24`. `ldb.dll` is *localisation text*, not textures. Upscaling feasibility tiers.

## Documentation Maintenance

When implementing a new feature:
1. **`FEATURES.md`** — Add a user-facing entry. Write for players, not developers. Include config instructions if the feature has settings (options panel path, slash command, etc.). Use the template in the file.
2. **`../IDEAS.md`** — Update the status column for the implemented idea.
3. **This file** — Update the "Confirmed Working" section if there's a new API or system integration.
4. **`src/ao/CLAUDE.md`** — Update if new struct layouts, RVAs, or calling conventions were discovered during implementation.

## Logging

Log file: `client/AOReloaded.log`. Truncated each launch. Flushed after every write. Tail with:
```bash
less +F client/AOReloaded.log    # or: tail -f client/AOReloaded.log
```
